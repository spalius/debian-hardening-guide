# Debian hardening guide
Seeing a general lack of guides which assist people in hardening Debian desktop installs, or even broadly Linux installs, I decided to write this guide. This is intended to still result in a practical, usable experience. Not every possible hardening measure is documented to due my own lack of knowledge. Work in progress.

# Physical security
## Encrypted boot
When choosing to install Debian, make sure you install using the encrypted install option. This will *not* encrypt the /boot partition. Generally speaking, an unencrypted boot is not a problem if your system supports Secure Boot. If it doesn't, [here are the instructions on how to set it up](https://cryptsetup-team.pages.debian.net/cryptsetup/encrypted-boot.html). You do end up with the requirement to input your password *three times*: first for the /boot partition, second for the /root partition and a third time to decrypt the /boot partition. [It is possible to avoid this with keyfiles](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1669615#p1669615).
## UEFI settings
Enable Secure Boot and set a password for your UEFI/BIOS. If your UEFI supports requiring a password to use the boot menu, enable such an option. Secure Boot makes offline tampering with your install difficult, especially with the kernel, initramfs. Debian is supported by Secure Boot and components are signed with Microsoft's third party key. If possible, it may be useful to remove all other keys that your UEFI supports. However, since some firmware on your computer might be signed by Microsoft, or by your OEM, you might end up with an unbootable system. Only do this if you know what you're doing.

Secure Boot can be a problem if you use out of tree kernel drivers. To automatically sign kernel drivers, you need to enroll your own Machine Owner Key (MOK), import it, or import the DKMS MOK. [Detailed instructions are available on the Debian wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/SecureBoot). Most UEFIs should support importing your own MOK. For ease of use, [importing the DKMS MOK](https://wiki.debian.org/SecureBoot#Making_DKMS_modules_signing_by_DKMS_signing_key_usable_with_the_secure_boot) is recommended.

# Sandboxing and Mandatory Access Control
Sandboxing can work very well as a vulnerability mitigation error. Even if your browser is compromised, assuming your sandboxing software isn't, it won't be able to access all your files on your disk or do other damage. Running untrusted code is never safe, even if it is sandboxed. Mandatory Access Control is important as well.

## AppArmor
[SELinux](https://selinuxproject.org/page/Main_Page) and [AppArmor](https://wiki.apparmor.net/) are both slightly different MAC implementations. Due to the greater ease of use of AppArmor, as well as it being pre-installed on a normal Debian desktop install, this guide will only explain how to set up AppArmor.
To view the status of AppArmor, execute ```sudo aa-status```.

By default, [Debian has AppArmor preinstalled](https://wiki.debian.org/AppArmor/HowToUse), but doesn't have profiles applied to more software. To install more profiles, execute ``` sudo apt install apparmor-profiles apparmor-profiles-extra```.

## Firejail
[Firejail](https://firejail.wordpress.com/) is a sandboxing utility meant for desktop applications. It is one of many on Linux: Bubblewrap is a common alternative. Bubblewrap by itself is not very usable and Bubblejail is not shipped with Debian 12. Firejail has a large amount of profiles pre-installed and will generally work out of the box.

To install Firejail, execute ```sudo apt install firejail```.

[In order to avoid privilege escalation vulnerabilities](https://firejail.wordpress.com/documentation-2/basic-usage/#suid), edit ```/etc/firejail/firejail.config``` to include ```force-nonewprivs yes```. This may break Chromium browsers.

Execute ```sudo firecfg``` to integrate Firejail with your desktop environment. Launching applications through your desktop environment will launch them with Firejail. Right click menus in your file browser should also work with this, when launching applications.

If an application doesn't work with Firejail properly, you can disable firecfg from integrating it with Firejail. Comment out, using #, an entry in ```/etc/firejail/firecfg.config``` and run firecfg again.

In order to disable network access for a specific application, use --net=none. For example, ```firejail vlc --net=none```. This may be useful for applications which don't need network access to work.

To enable AppArmor for Firejail, do ```sudo apparmor_parser -r /etc/apparmor.d/firejail-default```.

# Wayland
[Keyloggers on Xorg are a big issue](https://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2011/04/linux-security-circus-on-gui-isolation.html) Sandboxing can be rendered useless if any application can become a keylogger. Use Wayland with every single application that supports it. Firefox ESR, for some strange reason, doesn't run on Wayland by default on Debian 12, even if you are on a Wayland session. Launch Firefox with this environment variable: ```MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1```. To make this permanent, edit /usr/bin/firefox to include, in the exec line, ```env MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1``` before ```firefox-esr```. This may get overriden on updates. You can use a GUI method to add the environment variable for your desktop environment's application menu.

# Hardened memory allocation
[Hardened_malloc](https://github.com/GrapheneOS/hardened_malloc) was originally a project created for Android, which is implemented most heavily, to my knowledge, on GrapheneOS. Currently, Debian doesn't ship it, however, we can build it from source and use it with Firejail. It is recommended to read the documentation carefully.

Download the most current release and open the folder in your terminal. Use ```make``` to build it. In order to install hardened_malloc, copy libhardened_malloc.so in the /out folder to ```/usr/local/lib/```. You can use it with Firejail. This may break some applications and generally speaking, your performance will be decreased. For applications which require performance, don't use hardened_malloc.

To enable hardened_malloc system-wide, create and edit ```/etc/ld.so.preload``` to contain ```/usr/local/lib/libhardened_malloc.so```. This may break some applications and will lower performance. For video games and other performance requiring applications, consider disabling hardened_malloc. If you want to view which applications are using libhardened_malloc, do ```sudo lsof -w +c 0 /usr/lib/libhardened_malloc.so | awk '{print $1}' | sort```.

If you want to create an exception for an application, for example, Firefox, create a local profile and add ```blacklist /etc/ld.so.preload```. Firefox itself doesn't work with libhardened_malloc currently.

Make sure to raise ```vm.max_map_count```. In ```/etc/sysctl.d/hardened_malloc.conf```, add ```vm.max_map_count = 1048576```.

# Apt
Apt by default uses http for downloads. For improved privacy, in ```/etc/apt/sources.list```, you can replace http with https.

Apt has seccomp-bpf filtering, which restricts syscalls that APT is allowed to execute. Create /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/40sandbox and add:
```APT::Sandbox::Seccomp "true";```

# USBGuard
[USBGuard](https://usbguard.github.io/) helps protect against physical attacks. The default install will allow you to use all of your connected USB devices. New devices will be blocked, until you configure them in /etc/usbguard/rules.conf.

To install USBGuard, do ```sudo apt install usbguard```.

To enable USBGuard, do ```sudo systemctl start usbguard.service```. USBGuard has a Qt GUI for configuration.

Refer to the [documentation](https://usbguard.github.io/documentation/configuration.html) for usage.

# Sysctl
## Kernel self-protection
These are only a few of the hardening measures you can apply to sysctl. I've selected those I've deemed to be necessary, while not compromising usability. In order to enable them, edit GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT. For example:
```sysctl.kernel.kptr_restrict=2```.

After editing the file, run ```sudo update-grub```.

Kernel pointer leak mitigation.

```kernel.kptr_restrict=2```

You can restrict dmesg from leaking sensitive information, such as kernel pointers. 

```kernel.dmesg_restrict=1```

To disable booting another kernel during runtime:

``kernel.sysrq=4``
## Network
Protects against SYN flood attacks, which are a form of denial-of-service attack.

```net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies=1```

Protects against time-wait assassination.

```net.ipv4.tcp_rfc1337=1```

Packets received from all interfaces of the computer will be validated. This protects against IP spoofing.

```
net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter=1
net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter=1
```

Disable ICMP redirects.

```
net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects = 0
net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_redirects = 0
net.ipv4.conf.all.secure_redirects = 0
net.ipv4.conf.default.secure_redirects = 0
net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_redirects = 0
net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_redirects = 0
```

Disable ICMP redirect sending.

```
net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects = 0
net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects = 0
```

Disable ICMP echo requests.
```
net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_all = 1
net.ipv6.icmp.echo_ignore_all = 1
```

# Kernel hardening
Add these options to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT in /etc/default/grub. Make sure to run ```sudo update-grub``` after adding options.
To enable kernel lockdown mode:

```lockdown=confidentiality```
This may break some applications. A less strict version is:

```lockdown=integrity```

Disable slab merging.

```slab_nomerge```

Enable zeroing memory during allocation and free time. Erases sensitive information in memory.

```init_on_alloc=1 init_on_free=1```

This option randomizes page allocator freelists. Also improves performance.

```page_alloc.shuffle=1```

Randomise the kernel stack offset on each syscall.

```randomize_kstack_offset=on```

Disable debugfs, which reveals sensitive information about the kernel.

```debugfs=off```

Require kernel modules to be signed, before they are loaded. Make sure to have done the required steps at the start of the guide.

```module.sig_enforce=1```

## Blacklisting kernel modules
Some rare kernel modules can be disabled, to reduce attack surface. Create /etc/modprobe.d/attack-surface-reduction.conf and add:
```
install dccp /bin/false
install sctp /bin/false
install rds /bin/false
install tipc /bin/false
install n-hdlc /bin/false
install ax25 /bin/false
install netrom /bin/false
install x25 /bin/false
install rose /bin/false
install decnet /bin/false
install econet /bin/false
install af_802154 /bin/false
install ipx /bin/false
install appletalk /bin/false
install psnap /bin/false
install p8023 /bin/false
install p8022 /bin/false
install can /bin/false
install atm /bin/false
```
Bluetooth historically has been vulnerable to many security issues. If you do not use Bluetooth, consider adding these lines to the previously mentioned file. This will disable Bluetooth.
```
install bluetooth /bin/false
install btusb /bin/false
```
If you do not use them,disable Thunderbolt and FireWire, as they are often vulnerable to some attacks.
```
install firewire-core /bin/false
install thunderbolt /bin/false
```
To enable the IOMMU for DMA attack mitigation, add the following kernel boot parameters.

```intel_iommu=on amd_iommu=on```

Disabling the busmaster bit on all PCI bridges may be useful.

```efi=disable_early_pci_dma```

# Firewall
Debian, by default, doesn't come with a preinstalled firewall. This can be a security issue in public, untrusted networks.
[Firewalld](https://firewalld.org/) is the firewall installed by default on Fedora. It has a GUI to configure settings per network interface. To install it:

```sudo apt install firewalld firewall-config```
The default settings are reasonably secure. Unless you need ssh, disable the service.

# Identifiers
A unique Machine ID is stored in /etc/machine-id and /var/lib/dbus/achine-id. Edit these to the Whonix ID 
```b08dfa6083e7567a1921a715000001fb```.

## MAC randomization
To randomize your MAC address for more anonymity, install macchanger.
[Further documentation](https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/guides/linux-hardening.html#sysctl-kernel).

# GRUB password
To prevent unauthorized modification of GRUB menu entries, you can create a password.

```sudo grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2```

Enter the password and press the enter key to confirm it.

In ```/etc/grub.d/40_custom``` add:
```
set superusers="username"
password_pbkdf2 username password-hash
```
Do ```sudo chmod o-r /etc/grub.d/40_custom``` so that only root can read it.

In place of password-hash, add the previously generated hash. However, this will require you to input your GRUB password to boot. In order to make it so that you are only required the password to edit a menu entry, in ```/etc/grub.d/10_linux```, find
```
echo "menuentry '$(echo "$title" | grub_quote)' --unrestricted ${CLASS} \$menuentry_id_option 'gnulinux-$version-$type-$boot_device_id' {" | sed "s/^/$submenu_indentation/"
  else
      echo "menuentry '$(echo "$os" | grub_quote)' --unrestricted  ${CLASS} \$menuentry_id_option 'gnulinux-simple-$boot_device_id' {" | sed "s/^/$submenu_indentation/"
  fi    
```
And add --unrestricted options as displayed.

# Firefox
Hardening Firefox completely is outside the scope of this guide. [However, this is a useful guide](https://brainfucksec.github.io/firefox-hardening-guide).

Installing uBlock Origin is recommended. Enable advanced configuration and disable Javascript by default. Whitelist any website you need to use Javascript for. This should prevent a very large amount of vulnerabilities from being exploited, as Javascript historically has been a security issue in browsers. HTML exploits have existed, but are rare.

# dnscrypt-proxy
dnscrypt-proxy enables you to use DNS over HTTPS systemwide and also supports [DNS anonymization](https://github.com/dnscrypt/dnscrypt-proxy/wiki/Anonymized-DNS). 

Refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/dnscrypt/dnscrypt-proxy/wiki/Installation-on-Debian-and-Ubuntu) for installation.
